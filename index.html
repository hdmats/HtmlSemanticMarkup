        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p> 
            Owner <strong>Marty Matsen</strong> is a professional planner with a graduate degree in Urban and Regional Planning and is certified by the <em>American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP)</em>.
            Marty has 22+ years of municipal planning experience that includes more than 15 years as the Planning Director in 5 communities. Marty has also served as the Assistant Director 
            of a large State land agency and has land use planning experience in the intermountain-west, mid-west and the Washington D.C. metro area.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most recently Marty has served for more than 5 years as the <em>Community Development Director</em> for the City of Bozeman, Montana, listed nationally as one of the fastest growing
            micropolitan cities during the entirety of his tenure. 
        </p>
        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>
            Martyâ€™s experience in local government, specifically at the Director level means he understands the politics, processes, regulations and personalities that can affect and 
            ultimately determine project entitlement. While each community has its own zoning, subdivision, design, and development regulations many commonalities exist. The key is 
            knowing how the pieces work together, or against each other. Marty knows how to put the puzzle pieces together.
